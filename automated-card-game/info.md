## Rules

The rules of this card game are quite simple.

1. There are two players.
2. The cards (13 cards for every of the 4 colors) are all dealt equally to each player (random).
3. Each round, player 1 lays his "top" card down face up at the same time that player 2 lays his "top" card down face up. Whoever has the highest value card, wins both round and takes both cards.
4. The winning cards are added to the bottom of the winners deck (in player order).
5. Aces are high.
6. If both cards are of equal value - three cards are dealt from each hand face down and then 1 more face up to war again. the winner takes all the cards. If this ties repeat the process again.
7. The player that runs out of cards loses.

Hint: The "top" of the deck is the index 0.
